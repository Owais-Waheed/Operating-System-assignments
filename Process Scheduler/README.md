## Process Schedulers Assignment

### Introduction
Implement various process scheduling policies, including First In First Out (FIFO), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Time Completion First (STCF), and Round Robin (RR). The scheduling algorithms and performance metrics are explained.

### How to Run
- Execute the program to experience different process scheduling policies.
- Sample Input :
`3`
`RR`
`P1 : 1 2 : 7 : 3`
`P2 : 1 5 : 3 : 5`
`P3 : 1 : 6 : 2`
- Observe the system's performance metrics, throughput, average response time, and average turnaround time.

### Implemented Scheduling Policies
1. FIFO (First In First Out)
2. SJF (Shortest Job First)
3. STCF (Shortest Time Completion First)
4. RR (Round Robin)

### Performance Metrics
- Throughput
- Average Response Time
- Average Turnaround Time
